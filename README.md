# Astro
This repository is for sharing some of my simple but effective codes used for 
astronomical analysis. Description of each code can be found inside the 
corresponding code file. *NOT regularly maintained anymore.*

## `extract_spectral_para_v2.py`
### SpecPara
Python class for extracting spectral parameters (e.g., velocity coverage, 
integrated flux) from velocity-flux spectra.

## `HIFI/`
Contains modules and scripts for the HIFI project.
